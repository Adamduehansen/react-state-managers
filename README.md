# React State Management Showcase
This is a repository where I try out different state managers for React with the purpose of getting to know them. Each showcase is build around a todo application which these features:

  1. Adding a todo
  2. Deleting a todo
  3. Toggle a todo completed or incompleted
  4. Filter completed todos.
  5. Load todos from storage.
